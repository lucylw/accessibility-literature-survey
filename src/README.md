## Qualitative Analysis Scripts
The `QualitativeAnalysis.ipynb` notebook must be run with the `environment.yml` Anaconda environment. 

Follow the instructions below and consult the [Managing Environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) section in the conda docs for more details. There is also a nice conda cheetsheet [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).

### Step 1 Open your Anaconda terminal and go to the src dir
On **Mac**, this should be as simple as opening `terminal` (or, for example, use [`iterm2`](https://iterm2.com/)â€”my preferred terminal program).

On **Windows**, open the `Anaconda Powershell Prompt`.

Make sure you are in the `/src` directory. For example, for me (on my Mac), this is:

```
> pwd
/Users/jonf/Git/accessibility-literature-survey/src
```

### Step 2: create an environment from the environment.yml file

```
> conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Optionally, if you'd like to list the active conda environments on your system and verify that the `a11y-qual-analysis` environment was created:

```
> conda env list
```

### Step 2: activate the environment

```
> conda activate a11y-qual-analysis
```

### Step 3: open jupyter notebook
Now you should see the command line prompt prefixed by the current environment: `(a11y-qual-analysis)`. So, your command prompt should look like the following or something similar:

```
(a11y-qual-analysis)$
```

Now you can type in `jupyter notebook` and find `QualitativeAnalysis.ipynb`. It's easiest to do this from the root dir (e.g., `\accessibility-literature-survey\` or the src directory `\accessibility-literature-survey\src`).

```
(a11y-qual-analysis)$ jupyter notebook
```

In Jupyter Notebook environment, navigate to the `QualitativeAnalysis.ipynb` file and open it.
